The fiber orientation distribution (FOD) functions were estimated using the fourth order constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) algorithm in MRtrix3.

The functions are stored as 9 spherical harmonics coefficients:
volume 1: l=0, m=0;
volume 2: l=2, m=-2 (imaginary part of m=2 SH) ;
volume 3: l=2, m=-1 (imaginary part of m=1 SH) ;
volume 4: l=2, m=0 ;
volume 5: l=2, m=1 (real part of m=1 SH) ;
volume 6: l=2, m=2 (real part of m=2 SH) ;
etc...
