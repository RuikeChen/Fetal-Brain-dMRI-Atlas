# Fetal-Brain-dMRI-Atlas

A spatiotemporal atlas generated from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) scans of a Chinese population with 89 normal fetuses between 24 weeks and 38 weeks of gestation.

This atlas contains the weekly templates of the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) coefficients (in "Releases"), diffusion tensors, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived maps including fractional anisotropy (FA), color fractional anisotropy (CFA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD).
